It's great that you're focusing on Java and Spring Boot to prepare for a backend developer role in a multinational corporation (MNC). Here’s a step-by-step roadmap tailored to your situation as a fresh developer:

---

### **1. Master the Fundamentals of Java**
MNCs value strong foundational knowledge because it enables developers to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

- **Key Java Topics to Focus On:**
  - **Core Java**:
    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
    - Collections Framework (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`, etc.).
    - Exception handling.
    - File I/O and Serialization.
    - Generics, Lambda Expressions, and Streams API.
  - **Multithreading**:
    - Threads, `Runnable`, synchronization, and locks.
    - Executors and modern concurrency (from `java.util.concurrent`).
  - **Java 8+ Features**:
    - Functional programming concepts (Streams, Optional, Method References).
    - Default and static methods in interfaces.
    - New Date-Time API (`java.time`).
  - **Java Memory Management**:
    - Garbage collection and understanding JVM internals.

> **Action Step**: Complete "Head First Java" and supplement it with online resources like freeCodeCamp or paid courses on platforms like Udemy.

---

### **2. Dive Deep Into Spring Boot and the Ecosystem**
Spring Boot is a must-have skill for backend developers in MNCs due to its widespread adoption in enterprise applications.

- **Spring Boot Essentials**:
  - Spring Boot annotations (`@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.).
  - Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).
  - Application properties/yaml configurations.
  - Creating REST APIs with `@RequestMapping` and `@GetMapping`.

- **Spring Core Features**:
  - Bean lifecycle management.
  - AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).
  - Spring Data JPA (repositories, relationships, query methods).

- **Advanced Spring Topics**:
  - Authentication and Authorization with Spring Security (JWT, OAuth2).
  - Spring Boot Actuator (monitoring and health checks).
  - Caching (e.g., `@Cacheable` with Redis).
  - Integrations with messaging systems (RabbitMQ, Kafka).

- **Testing**:
  - Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito.
  - Spring Boot testing (`@SpringBootTest`).

> **Action Step**: Build a few small projects to solidify your understanding. For example:
  - A basic **ecommerce API**.
  - A **CRUD application** for managing tasks or products.

---

### **3. Learn SQL and Database Design**
Working with databases is integral to backend development.

- **Database Fundamentals**:
  - Understand relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - Writing SQL queries (CRUD operations, joins, subqueries).
  - Database design (primary keys, foreign keys, normalization).

- **Spring Data JPA**:
  - Mapping entities (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`).
  - Custom queries with JPQL or native SQL.

> **Action Step**: Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank (SQL challenges), or build a small database for one of your projects.

---

### **4. Explore Microservices Architecture**
Many MNCs build enterprise applications using **microservices**.

- **Core Concepts**:
  - Service decomposition (how to split a monolith into microservices).
  - Communication between microservices (REST APIs, gRPC, message brokers like Kafka).
  - Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, rate limiting).

- **Spring Boot with Microservices**:
  - Spring Cloud (Netflix Eureka, API Gateway, Config Server).
  - Monitoring with tools like Spring Boot Actuator, Prometheus, and Grafana.
  - API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.

> **Action Step**: Enhance your side project to follow microservices principles. For example:
  - Split the ecommerce app into separate services: **Product Service**, **Order Service**, and **User Service**.

---

### **5. Build Strong Problem-Solving Skills**
MNCs often have coding rounds in their interviews to assess problem-solving and algorithmic skills.

- **Key Topics**:
  - Data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables).
  - Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming).
  - Big O notation (understanding time/space complexity).

- **Practice Platforms**:
  - **Beginner-Friendly**: HackerRank, CodeChef.
  - **Intermediate/Advanced**: LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks.

> **Action Step**: Start with easy problems and gradually move to medium-level questions on LeetCode.

---

### **6. Get Comfortable With Tools and DevOps Basics**
MNCs look for developers who can work with tools and understand the development lifecycle.

- **Tools to Learn**:
  - Git (version control): Branching, merging, pull requests.
  - Maven/Gradle: Dependency management and project builds.
  - IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (shortcuts and debugging).

- **DevOps Basics**:
  - Docker: Containerize Spring Boot applications.
  - CI/CD: Learn basic workflows using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
  - Monitoring: Basic knowledge of ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

---

### **7. Write Clean Code**
- Learn the principles of **Clean Code** (by Robert C. Martin).
- Focus on meaningful variable names, small methods, and avoiding code duplication.
- Familiarize yourself with design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy, etc.).

---

### **8. Build a Strong Portfolio**
- **Project Ideas**:
  - A **task manager** with user authentication.
  - A **blog platform** with roles (admin, user).
  - An **inventory management system** for small businesses.

- Host projects on GitHub and ensure they are:
  - Well-documented (README files, API endpoints).
  - Tested (include unit and integration tests).

---

### **9. Prepare for Interviews**
MNC interviews are often multi-round and include:
1. **Aptitude Round**: Logical reasoning and coding tests.
2. **Technical Interviews**: Topics include Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and problem-solving.
3. **System Design**: Basic understanding of system components (databases, caching, APIs).
4. **Behavioral Round**: Emphasizes teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

> **Action Step**: Mock interviews on platforms like Pramp or with friends can help you gain confidence.

---

### **10. Stay Consistent and Keep Learning**
MNCs value developers who stay up-to-date with trends and continuously improve their skills.

- Follow blogs like Baeldung (for Spring Boot) and DZone.
- Explore additional Java frameworks and tools as needed (e.g., Hibernate, Apache Kafka).

---

### Suggested Learning Timeline:
1. **First 3 Months**: Core Java, Spring Boot basics, small projects.
2. **Next 3 Months**: Spring Boot advanced topics, database design, microservices.
3. **After 6 Months**: Problem-solving (LeetCode) and DevOps basics.
