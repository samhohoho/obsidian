Some classes just should NOT be instantiated.
What the fork is animal?
What are the specification? (shape, color, size)
```java
Animal animal = new Animal();
```

Marking the class as `abstract`, the compiler stop creating an instance of that type.
Use it as a polymorphic array.

An `abstract class` has virtually no use, no value, no purpose in life, unless it is extended.

An `abstract class` can have static members.
